This project was coded in python 3.8 using Anaconda.
The requirements can be found in requirements.txt.

To install dependencies in a new environment please type:
conda create --name <env_name> --file requirements.txt

Please refer to the notebook "Aftertime.ipynb" for the results submitted after the time limit.

Explanation: My environment crashed hard during the test, taking the main tool I was aiming to use away. I speant circa 45 minutes between searching for errors, attempting different reinstallations and other things.
As a result, I did not get that much done, which left a pretty bad aftertaste.

After the time was done, I created a fresh new env in 3.8 instead of the 3.10 I was using, and now everything installed and ran just fine.
To clean the aftertaste, I finished implementing the most basic version of auto_arima as originally intended.
